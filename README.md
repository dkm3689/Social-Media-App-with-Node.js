# Social Media App REST API

## Overview 🌐
This is a **Social Media App REST API** built using **Node.js**, **Express**, **MongoDB**, and **Mongoose**. The API supports user authentication, posts, comments, likes, and more, providing a scalable and secure backend for a social media platform. 

The app is designed with **JWT-based authentication** for secure user sessions and **Bcrypt** for password hashing. With the **MVC architecture**, the app ensures clean code organization and easy maintainability.

## Features ✨
- **User Authentication & Security** 🔐: 
   - Secure user authentication with **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for token-based sessions.
   - **Bcrypt** is used for securely hashing user passwords, preventing unauthorized access.
   
- **OTP-Based Email Verification** 📧:
   - Leveraged **Nodemailer** for OTP-based email verification, reducing fake sign-ups by 30-40% and improving user security.

- **API Development** 💻:
   - Developed a set of **RESTful APIs** for managing user data, posts, likes, comments, and friendships.
   - All APIs are thoroughly tested and documented with **Postman** for easy integration and testing.

- **MongoDB Schema Design** 🗂️:
   - Designed a scalable MongoDB schema for users, posts, comments, and friendships using **Mongoose**.
   - Optimized database queries to reduce data retrieval times by **35%**.

- **MVC Architecture** 🏗️:
   - Used the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** pattern to structure the backend, ensuring separation of concerns for easy maintainability and future scalability.
